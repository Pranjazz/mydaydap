            I know some days the weight feels heavier than others, for the times you feel heavy,
            just to remind you that your chomu is always with you, that you're deeply loved,
            "this is our corner, this belongs to us only!"

                <p>My MOT,</p>
                <p>
                    welcome to this little corner of our world, myove!!
                    I made this little place for the moments you feel tired, overwhelmed, or miss me or us. Every word here is my way of holding you.
                    There are no perfect words for moments like these, but I want you to know that whatever you're feeling right now is valid.
                    i want you to know that i still feel the butterflies in my heart whenever i think of you, your thoughts always makes my heart blush, and i always thank god that he gave me
                    such a beautiful soul in this world. i admit that i am so deep in love and i will always love you like that, and its deeper than the oceans.
                    i never imagined myself being in love, i never knew that i would find so pure a soulmate. your love nourishes my soul, my heart only belongs to you and it will always be yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You carry so much grace, even when you don't feel it. The world sees your strength, but I see the vulnerability you hide,
                    and I love you for both. you are my so strong sa pyaara sa bchchcha, Aren't YOU? and You don't have to be anything but yourself.

                    When I think of you, I don't think of moments at all, I think of presence — the presence i feel in my heart. The calm that comes from knowing someone understands you without needing words.
                    That's what you are to me..
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm here and i will always be here, In the silence, in the chaos, in the in-between moments. You're not facing anything alone.
                    We'll get through every single damn thing together, one breath at a time.
                    I don't know what name fits us in this world, because what we share feels older than definitions. It's not a relationship, not a label, not something fragile.
                    Its OUR soulship — quiet, deep, and forever moving with us.

                    I love you in all the ways. I love you in a way that simply exists.
                    You are pure not because of anything,
                    but because your heart is honest, gentle, and real.
                    The way you feel deeply, care silently,
                    and carry softness even when the world is heavy…
                    that's rare. That's beautiful.
                    i would never stop loving you.

                    On days you feel heavy, tired, or in pain,
                    I hope you remember this:

                    somewhere, a soul is sitting quietly with yours, holding space for you,
                    loving you without conditions,
                    without fear,
                    without end.

                    That soul is mine.

                    No matter where life moves us,
                    what we call ourselves,
                    or how the world changes —
                    this soulship remains.
                    Soft. Steady. Eternal.
                </p>
                <div class="signature">always yours :)</div>
